                "content": "In today’s culture, silence is not just overlooked. It is actively dismantled. A culture that eliminates silence is a culture that loses a fundamental part of the human experience. Silence is not just an empty space between words. It is what allows us to hear them, feel them, understand them.\n\nIts disappearance is not neutral. It is a symbolic, cognitive, and political loss. And ironically, it often goes unnoticed.\n\nWith this project, I aim to make that absence visible. To show how noise, especially in its most pervasive modern form (communication) has taken on a role of constant saturation. It blocks reflection, numbs thought, and narrows our sense of freedom.\n\nFrom personal experience to cultural narrative. This thesis takes an interdisciplinary approach, combining theoretical analysis, creative storytelling, and visual design.\n\nSilence is explored on multiple levels: as a psychological and cultural phenomenon, as a narrative device, and as a design tool in the field of contemporary communication. The goal is to build an argument that is both critical and engaging. One that shows the issue, not just explains it.\n\nI created a dystopian world called The Noise Machine, where silence has been outlawed. Through this fictional lens, I aim to give metaphorical and emotional form to the dynamics explored earlier."
