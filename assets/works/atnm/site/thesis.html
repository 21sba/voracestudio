                This thesis began, first and foremost, as a personal feeling. I've always had a deep relationship with silence. It has fascinated me, comforted me, protected me. As an introvert, I never saw silence as something to avoid. To me, it was natural. Necessary. But as I grew older, I started to feel out of place. Out of sync. As if the way I existed in the world was somehow wrong. Where there are no words, people assume something is missing. So, in order not to fall behind, I too learned to fill the space. To speak, to respond, to share, even when I had nothing to say. This tension between who I am and what the world expects pushed me to dig deeper. At first, I thought it was just something personal, a part of my personality clashing with a world that moves too fast. But the more I explored, the clearer it became that this wasn't just about me. <span class="important">There was something larger at play, something more widespread and deeply rooted: an entire culture that smothers silence, treats it like a flaw, and tries to eliminate it.</span> That's where the need arose, and from it, the idea to dedicate space to this subject. A research project. A story. A manifesto.

                    <h2>Cultural Context and the Problem</h2>
                    <p>
                        We live in a culture that rewards visibility, speeds up communication, and pushes for instant reaction. <span class="important">A culture where speaking has become more important than actually having something to say.</span> Expression is no longer a conscious act. It has become a constant state. We are always connected, always available, always performing. Every space, whether physical, digital, or mental, is saturated with a continuous stream of words, images, notifications, and content. It all becomes noise. <span class="important">Every pause is filled. Every void is seen as failure.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this environment, <span class="important">noise is no longer just a matter of sound. It has turned into a cultural principle. A paradigm.</span> Noise prevents focus, dilutes attention, and blocks deep listening. It is the accumulation of competing signals, overlapping inputs that make it harder to find direction. It has become a systemic condition. Continuous, invasive, internalized. And it manifests not only through sound or speech, but also through excessive visual production, information overload, emotional saturation. It is a kind of noise that is felt not only by the ears, but by the mind, the body, and our relationships.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Within this reality, <span class="important">silence has lost its rightful place. It is not expected. It is not protected. It is not considered productive.</span> It does not align with the dominant logic of constant presence. Silence has become a disruption, something that breaks the flow, interrupts the chain of endless participation. And so, it is avoided, sidelined, erased.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is no longer time for silence, and often, no ability to inhabit it. This dynamic affects our psyche, our relationships, our creativity, and our ability to think independently. <span class="important">Without silence, experience becomes flat. Our inner life fades. Listening turns into reacting. Language becomes noise. Words lose their depth. Communication turns into mere transmission.</span>

                    <h2>Thesis and Objectives</h2>
                    <p>
                        In today's culture, silence is not just overlooked. <span class="important">It is actively dismantled.</span> A culture that eliminates silence is a culture that loses a fundamental part of the human experience. <span class="important">Silence is not just an empty space between words. It is what allows us to hear them, feel them, understand them.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="important">Its disappearance is not neutral. It is a symbolic, cognitive, and political loss.</span> And ironically, it often goes unnoticed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With this project, I aim to make that absence visible. To show how noise, especially in its most pervasive modern form — communication — has taken on a role of constant saturation. <span class="important">It blocks reflection, numbs thought, and narrows our sense of freedom.</span>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        From personal experience to cultural narrative. <span class="important">This thesis takes an interdisciplinary approach, combining theoretical analysis, creative storytelling, and visual design.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Silence is explored on multiple levels: as a psychological and cultural phenomenon, as a narrative device, and as a design tool in the field of contemporary communication. <span class="important">The goal is to build an argument that is both critical and engaging. One that shows the issue, not just explains it.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="important">I created a dystopian world called The Noise Machine, where silence has been outlawed.</span> Through this fictional lens, I aim to give metaphorical and emotional form to the dynamics explored in the earlier sections.
